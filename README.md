Electric Vehicles are pretty awesome but they do need somewhere to be charged and finding a place to do so isn't always trivial. Luckily, there's an app for that. That app is SparkMap. 

Finally an EV companion app that's not a sluggish and slow wrapper around a poorly designed website. SparkMap enables you to easily find charging stations in your area or anywhere else in the world. It's even open source! Filtering features lets you pick what kind of chargers you are interested in and the offline option is there to save you as SparkMap constantly maintains a cache for the times you're stuck without a internet connection.

SparkMap offers a smooth and responsive Apple Maps based experience and 3D Touch lets you peek and pop charging station details from the list of nearby chargers. SparkMap tells you immediately how long it will take you to get there and one-touch navigation helps guide you all the way there. Charging station photos help you check out chargers before you go there. Found a charging station without  photo? SparkMap will let you easily capture and submit yours.

All network traffic is encrypted with SSL to ensure your personal information stays safe and SparkMap does not use any ads, third party analytics or in-app-purchases.

Say goodbye to agonizingly poor charging station apps and say hello to an app done right! Say hello to SparkMap!
